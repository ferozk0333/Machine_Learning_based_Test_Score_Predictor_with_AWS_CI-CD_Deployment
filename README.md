## End to End Machine Learning Project - Regression

Description: An end-to-end regression solution implemented using a modular programming approach. The model predicts students' exam performance based on several highly correlated features like parental background, course completion, scores in other sections and more. Deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk using CI code pipeline

UPDATE: AWS CI-CD Production Grade Deployment using ECR, EC2 and Dockers.

## Docker Setup In EC2 commands to be Executed
#optional

sudo apt-get update -y

## Configure EC2 as self-hosted runner:

GitHub -> Settings -> Actions -> Runners -> New -> Linux -> Execute the commands in EC2 instance -> Press Enter to skip
NOTE:   Enter the name of runner: [press Enter for IP...] :self-hosted
Skip rest by pressing Enter
(Runner - Whenever code commit - acts as a trigger - CI CD deploy)

./run.sh  ---> Listening for Jobs ==> Any push that happens in repository
